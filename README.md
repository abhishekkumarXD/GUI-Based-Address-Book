## We want to build an address book that is capable of storing the name, address & phone number of a person. 

##  The feature list includes:
	-> Add - to add a new person record
	-> Delete - to delete an existing person record by name
	-> Search - to search a person record by name
	-> Exit - to exit from the application
  
## As we are creating an GUI application, we need to use a toolkit called SWING that is available in Java.

### SWING 
    Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. It's a part of a Oracle Java Foundation
    Classes - an API for providing a graphical user interface for Java programs.
    Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than
    the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit.
